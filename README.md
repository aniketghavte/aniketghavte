I am Aniket Ghavte.

I build products that matter. **My work speaks through my code - TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, Machine Learning, AI - the languages through which I shape digital experiences.**

Currently focused on building Mars.

My interests span physics, science, space, and robotics - domains where innovation meets exploration. I believe technology is the only reality.

**I am known for delivering exceptional work.** Each project is approached with both technical precision and creative vision.

I am both a developer and an artist, finding beauty in elegant solutions and clean architecture.
